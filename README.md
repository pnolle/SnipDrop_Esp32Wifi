# SnipDrop
Code for Wi-Fi access point and clients for my LED rollup banner project 'SnipDrop'.
http://snippetupperlaser.com

## Discontinued
Needed to switch to PlatformIO when implementing Ethernet instead of WiFi. Using the W5500 ethernet shield came with specific requirements to library versions that were way easier to handle with PlatformIO. Please refer to [this repository](https://github.com/pnolle/SnipDrop_Esp32Eth_PlatformIO.git) for the code implementing the W5500 ethernet shield and further development.

## How it works
* Ableton Live (or any other DAW) sends out MIDI
* Qlc+ receives MIDI and has mappings to a bunch of functions, matrices etc.
* ESP32 #1 is Access Point, opens up Wi-Fi ``SnipDrop``
* Laptop with Ableton and Qlc+ as well as the other two ESP32 are on the AP's Wi-Fi.
* Qlc+ sends out Artnet to fixed IPs of all 3 ESPs.
* ESPs use FastLED to [get alight](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rTCefc-uuEw/maxresdefault.jpg).

```
// Configure IP addresses of the local access point
IPAddress local_IP_AP(192, 168, 1, 22); // C strip
IPAddress local_IP_C1(192, 168, 1, 31); // A strip
IPAddress local_IP_C2(192, 168, 1, 32); // L strip
```

## Sources
Receive data from multiple boards: https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp-now-many-to-one-esp32/

## Installation
Copy secrets.h_template and rename to secrets.h, fill in SSID and Password for ESP32 Wi-Fi.

## Libraries
Developed and tested with
* FastLED version 3.5.0
* ArtnetWifi version 1.5.1

## Troubleshooting

### Wi-Fi password not accepted
Try typing it, don't copy. There might be invisible chars.

### Wi-Fi password not accepted or other spooky things
When typing the password didn't fix the issue, re-flashing the MCU with the option ``Tools / Erase All Flash Before Sketch Upload: Enabled`` in Arduino IDE helped. This will probably help for other weird issues as well, in case sth's gone sideways on the dev board.

### Client doesn't get IP address via DHCP on Mac OS
Go to ``System Settings => Wi-Fi => SnipDrop Details => TCP/IP => Renew DHCP Lease`` => Asks if unsaved changes shall be applied (even if nothing has been changed). For some reason, it doesn't renew when clicking ``Apply``, so click ``Don't Apply`` and enjoy your IP address.

Via terminal, it should work with ``sudo ipconfig set en0 DHCP`` (given that en0 is your device interface).
